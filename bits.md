## Bits

# Definition

A bit, short for "binary digit," is the smallest unit of digital information. It can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. The term "bit" is a contraction of these two binary states.

# Binary System

Bits are the foundation of the binary number system, which is a base-2 numeral system. In binary, each digit (bit) represents a power of 2. The rightmost bit is 2^0, the next is 2^1, then 2^2, and so on. This binary representation is essential for encoding information in computers because electronic circuits can easily distinguish between two states (on/off, high/low, 1/0).
