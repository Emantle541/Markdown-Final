## Bits

# Definition
A bit, short for "binary digit," is the smallest unit of digital information. It can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. The term "bit" is a contraction of these two binary states.

# Binary System
Bits are the foundation of the binary number system, which is a base-2 numeral system. In binary, each digit (bit) represents a power of 2. The rightmost bit is 2^0, the next is 2^1, then 2^2, and so on. This binary representation is essential for encoding information in computers because electronic circuits can easily distinguish between two states (on/off, high/low, 1/0).

# Boolean Logic
Bits play a fundamental role in Boolean logic, which is the basis of all digital computing. In Boolean logic, operations like AND, OR, and NOT are performed on individual bits. These operations form the basis of all the logical operations that computers can perform.
