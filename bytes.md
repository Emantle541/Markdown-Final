## Bytes

#Definition
A byte is a unit of digital information that consists of 8 bits. The term "byte" is a contraction of "binary eight." 
Bytes are fundamental building blocks in computer systems, and they are used to represent characters, store data, and execute various operations.

#Binary Representation
As mentioned earlier, a byte is made up of 8 bits, and each bit can have a value of either 0 or 1. 
The binary system is a base-2 numeral system, meaning that each digit (bit) in a binary number represents powers of 2.
Example: The binary representation of a byte might look like this: 01011010

#Uses of Bytes
**Character Encoding:** Bytes are commonly used to represent characters in computer systems. Various character encoding schemes, such as ASCII and Unicode, assign unique byte sequences to different characters.
**Memory Storage:** Bytes are the smallest addressable unit of memory in computer systems. Data, programs, and files are all stored and manipulated in terms of bytes.
**Communication:** Bytes are used to transmit data over networks. Whether it's the text in an email, an image in a web page, or a file download, data is sent and received in the form of bytes.
