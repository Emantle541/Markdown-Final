## Byte Size Units

Bytes are often used with prefixes to denote larger units of digital information. These units help express data sizes in a more human-readable and manageable form. Here are some commonly used byte size units:

# Bit
The smallest unit of digital information, with a binary value of 0 or 1.
# Byte
A group of 8 bits.
Common Usage: Used as the basic unit for representing characters and storing data.
# Kilobyte (KB)
1 KB is equal to 1024 bytes.
Common Usage: Often used to describe small data sizes, such as text files or small images.
# Megabyte (MB)
1 MB is equal to 1024 KB or 1,048,576 bytes.
Common Usage: Used to measure the size of files, photos, or documents.
# Gigabyte (GB)
1 GB is equal to 1024 MB or approximately 1,073,741,824 bytes.
Common Usage: Used to measure the storage capacity of hard drives, SSDs, and the size of large files like videos.
# Terabyte (TB)
1 TB is equal to 1024 GB or approximately 1,099,511,627,776 bytes.
Common Usage: Describes the capacity of modern storage devices, large datasets, and high-. videos.
# Petabyte (PB)
1 PB is equal to 1024 TB or approximately 1,125,899,906,842,624 bytes.
Common Usage: Used to measure data storage in massive data centers, cloud storage, and extensive archives.
# Exabyte (EB)
1 EB is equal to 1024 PB or approximately 1,152,921,504,606,846,976 bytes.
Common Usage: Describes extremely large datasets and global-scale storage systems.
# Zettabyte (ZB)
1 ZB is equal to 1024 EB or approximately 1,180,591,620,717,411,303,424 bytes.
Common Usage: Used in discussions about the vast amounts of data generated globally.
# Yottabyte (YB)
1 YB is equal to 1024 ZB or approximately 1,208,925,819,614,629,174,706,176 bytes.
Common Usage: This unit is theoretical and is not commonly encountered in practical storage scenarios yet. It's used in discussions about the potential future scale of data storage.
